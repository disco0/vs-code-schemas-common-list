# Schemas Common List for VS Code

**WARNING: This extension replaces `json.schemas` setting! Backup your settings file before installing this extension!!!**

This extension is fully based on [Schemas Store List](http://schemastore.org/json/). If you want more schemas, add to your `json.personalSchemas`, [create an issue](https://github.com/chrisvltn/vs-code-schemas-common-list/issues) in the [repository], or be free to make a pull request to [it].

## Features

Inserts a bunch of common schemas in your `json.schemas` settings, so now VS Code can suggest itens for your `.json` files a lot easier. 

## Extension Settings

- `json.personalSchemas`: Additional schemas to add to the list of schemas, it replaces the old `json.schemas` setting.

> See [JSON Schemas Settings in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-settings) to learn more.

## Usage
Rename your current `json.schemas` setting to `json.personalSchemas`, and install the extension. 

Done! Now you can write json free and securely!
